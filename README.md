# VARCONS_ML_PROJECT
This case study aims to analyze the sentiment expressed on Twitter during the COVID-19 lockdown. Using data collection methods like Twitter's API and data preprocessing techniques, such as text cleaning and tokenization, sentiment analysis tools and models are applied to categorize tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Visualizations, topic analysis, and geospatial insights are used to uncover trends and regional variations in sentiment over time. The study also explores how different topics and significant events during the lockdown influenced public sentiment, while considering ethical considerations related to user privacy. Ultimately, the analysis provides valuable insights into the evolving emotional responses of Twitter users to the COVID-19 lockdown.
